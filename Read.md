1.  **Update `requirements.txt`:**
    Make sure `gunicorn` is listed in your `requirements.txt` file:
    ```
    Flask
    boto3
    gunicorn
    # ... any other dependencies
    ```
    Then run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` or manually add `gunicorn==<version>` to pin it.

2.  **Create a `.dockerignore` file:**
    To prevent unnecessary files from being copied into your Docker image (which can increase build time and image size), create a `.dockerignore` file in the same directory as your `Dockerfile` with content like this:
    ```
    __pycache__/
    *.pyc
    *.pyo
    *.pyd
    .Python
    env/
    venv/
    .env
    .git
    .gitignore
    docker-compose.yml
    README.md
    *.log
    .vscode/
    .idea/
    ```
    Adjust this list based on your project structure.

**To build and run this Docker image:**

1.  **Build the image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t my-aws-cost-app .
    ```
2.  **Run the container:**
    Remember to pass your AWS credentials as environment variables to the container.
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 5000:5000 \
      -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" \
      -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" \
      -e AWS_REGION="us-east-1" \
      --name aws-cost-explorer-app \
      my-aws-cost-app
    ```
    Then access your app at `http://localhost:5000/dashboard` (or other routes).

This revised Dockerfile provides a more secure and production-ready way to containerize your Flask application.
